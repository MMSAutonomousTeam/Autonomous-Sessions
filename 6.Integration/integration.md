</div>

**Teleoperational Robots** are directly controlled by a human operator who uses a remote control or computer to send commands. This type of robot is often deployed in high-risk environments, such as **bomb disposal** or **remote surgeries.** The operator must maintain focus and react swiftly, as they are **responsible for every action the robot takes.** However, teleoperational robots can be **slower** and have **limitations in speed and range** due to their reliance on human control and the necessity for a stable communication link.

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/The-software-architecture-of-our-UAV-inspection-system.png" alt="System Components Diagram" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px;">
</div>

In contrast, **Autonomous Robots** can operate independently without human intervention. They leverage sensors to perceive their environment and make real-time decisions based on their observations. These robots can adapt to changes in their surroundings, making them ideal for applications like self-driving cars and robotic vacuum cleaners. In this system, **the robot itself determines its actions based on the information it gathers.**

### Key Differences

1. **Control**:

   - **Teleoperational Robots**: Operated by humans who send commands, requiring close attention and skill. Their reliance on human input can slow reaction times and limit responsiveness to environmental changes.
   - **Autonomous Robots**: Make decisions independently, using sensors to understand and respond to their surroundings quickly.
2. **Communication**:

   - **Teleoperational Robots**: Depend on a strong communication link with the operator; if this connection is lost, the robot may halt or become difficult to control, limiting operational range.
   - **Autonomous Robots**: Function independently without the need for human communication, processing information and reacting to their environment autonomously, allowing greater freedom of movement.
3. **Software Complexity**:

   - **Teleoperational Robots**: Utilize simpler software focused on enabling effective human control, without the need for complex decision-making processes.
   - **Autonomous Robots**: Feature advanced software that facilitates perception, decision-making, and learning, enabling them to adapt and improve over time.

***This foundational understanding of teleoperational and autonomous robots will set the stage for our exploration of how to integrate these concepts into real-world applications. Let’s dive in!***

### System Response to Environmental Challenges

Understanding how the system responds to environmental challenges is crucial. The balance between the computational requirements needed to formulate an appropriate response and the time constraints posed by the circumstances is at the core of designing effective robot architectures.

### Architectures for Timely Responses

Murphy (2000) discusses various robotic architectures—or paradigms—in her book (introduction to AI robotics ) that illustrate the interplay between three fundamental actions: **sense** , **plan** , and **act** . These paradigms define how sensory data is processed and propagated throughout the system, shaping how robots interact with their environments and respond to challenges.

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/paradigms.png" alt="paradigms" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;">
</div>

### hierarchical appraoch :

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/horizontal.png" alt="horizontal" style="width: 100%; max-width: 1000px;">
</div>

The *hierarchical paradigm* was historically dominant in AI robotics, emphasizing detailed world modeling and sequential planning. While effective in structured environments, this approach often faced challenges. As the robot constructed its model and deliberated on its next steps, the external environment would likely change, resulting in a behavior known as "look-and-lurch." A notable example is  *Shakey* , a robot developed at the Stanford Research Institute in the 1970s, which was controlled by a remote computer and exhibited this behavior while attempting to manipulate blocks.

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/cc64e1e5-shakeysriinternational1-1487364021434.png" alt="shaky" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
</div>

### Reactive Systems

In contrast, the *reactive paradigm* organizes components vertically, providing a more direct path from sensors to effectors. This approach facilitates quicker responses to environmental stimuli, enhancing the robot’s adaptability.

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/vertical.png" alt="vertical" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px;">
</div>

However, this vertical organization introduces potential contention over the effectors. For instance, when steering a car, multiple components—like avoiding an obstacle or exploring—may compete for control over the robot's actuators. To address this, Brooks introduced the **subsumption architecture**, which allows higher-level components to subsume lower-level ones.

In this architecture, behaviors are organized into layers with an arbitration scheme, enabling higher-level modules to inhibit the inputs and outputs of lower-level modules. The most basic components, termed modules, possess inputs, outputs, and reset capabilities, facilitating smooth transitions between states based on sensor input and internal conditions.

These modules can be thought of as simple computational units, akin to circuits or finite state machines, that continuously transition between states based on environmental feedback.

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/avoid.png" alt="vertical" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px;">
</div>

### hybrid archetecute :

A more recent development in robotic design is the hybrid architecture, which seeks to integrate the strengths of both reactive and deliberative paradigms. This three-layered system comprises a reactive layer, a deliberative layer, and a middle layer that coordinates between the two.

In this architecture, the reactive layer allows for quick responses to immediate stimuli, while the deliberative layer enables longer-term planning and strategy development. The middle layer acts as a mediator, ensuring that the system can think and act independently and concurrently, striking a balance between rapid reaction and thoughtful decision-making.

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/hybrid.png" alt="vertical" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px;">
</div>

***By understanding these architectural paradigms, we can better design systems that effectively respond to dynamic environments, enhancing the capabilities and reliability of autonomous robots.***

### The Importance of Integration

We've explored the different architectures for robot control, from the slow and deliberate hierarchical approach to the fast and reactive approach. But there's a key concept that ties them all together: integration.

As Rodney Brooks famously said, **"Robotics is the art of integration."**   A robot is not simply a collection of parts – it's a complex system where hardware, software, sensors, and actuators all work together seamlessly. The success of a robot hinges on how well these elements are integrated.

#### Integration is crucial for several reasons:

- **Efficiency**: A well-integrated system ensures smooth information flow between components, leading to faster response times and more efficient operations. This seamless communication allows the robot to act quickly and accurately in dynamic environments.
- **Performance**: When all components work in harmony, the robot can perform its tasks with greater precision and reliability. Effective integration minimizes errors and enhances the overall functionality of the system.
- **Flexibility:**: Modular and well-integrated systems can be easily adapted to new tasks or environments. By adding or replacing components, robots can evolve to meet changing requirements, making them versatile in a variety of applications.
- **Scalability**: Integration facilitates the development of complex robots with diverse functionalities. By seamlessly incorporating additional components, we can enhance the robot's capabilities without compromising its performance.

### two main steps in integration :

To achieve effective integration in robotic systems, we focus on two main steps:

* **software integration:** This step involves ensuring that various software components work together seamlessly. It encompasses integrating algorithms for perception, planning, and control, as well as establishing communication protocols between different software modules. Effective software integration allows for real-time data processing and decision-making, enabling the robot to respond appropriately to environmental changes.
* **hardware - software integration:** This step focuses on the alignment between hardware components (sensors, actuators, and processors) and the software that drives them. It involves configuring the hardware to accurately interpret sensor data and translate software commands into physical actions. Successful hardware-software integration ensures that the robot operates efficiently and reliably, with minimal latency between sensing, processing, and acting.

## software integration

> **to integrate the software components there are many archetectures to use**

**Software architecture** refers to the high-level structure of a software system, defining how components are organized and how they interact with each other. In the context of robotics, the software architecture is crucial for determining how different software modules are integrated to control the robot's behavior effectively.

## ROS2

finished the software lets put our software into work

### what is ROS ?

The acronym ROS stands for Robot Operating System. It is important to clarify that ROS is not a traditional operating system that replaces Linux or Windows; rather, it serves as middleware that enhances the capabilities of robotic applications. The "2" in ROS 2 indicates that it is the second generation of this middleware.

Robot Operating System (ROS) consists of a suite of open-source algorithms, hardware drivers, and tools designed to facilitate the development of robot control software. Despite its name, it is fundamentally:

* **A Communication System**  (including Publish-Subscribe and Remote Method Invocation)
* A set of **Frameworks & Tools** (for building systems, managing dependencies, visualization, recording, and replaying data)
* **An Ecosystem**  that includes language bindings, drivers, libraries, and simulation tools (like Gazebo)

#### Currently, ROS exists in two generations: ROS1 and ROS2.

* **ROS1** was primarily used for education and academic research.
* **ROS2** is tailored for commercial robots.

ROS offers mature libraries for various functions, including navigation, control, motion planning, vision, and simulation. Notably, RViz is a key visualization tool used with ROS, while Gazebo serves as a vital simulation tool for developers. Additionally, the OpenCV library is utilized for detection purposes in ROS 2.

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/ros2_libraries.png" alt="ros2 libraries" style="width: 70%; max-width: 800px;">
</div>

## ROS 2 Architecture

ROS 2 features a distributed real-time system architecture. Various components, such as sensors, motion controllers, detection algorithms, artificial intelligence, and navigation algorithms, are represented as nodes within this architecture. The DDS middleware chosen for ROS 2 facilitates data exchange and communication among these nodes in a distributed environment.

### different between ros1 and ros2

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/different_betweenros1andros2.png" alt="ros1 and ros2 " style="width: 70%; max-width: 800px;" >
</div>

#### Key differences between ROS1 and ROS2 include:

* **Operating System Support**: ROS1 primarily supports Linux, while ROS2 enhances portability across various operating systems, including Linux, Windows, macOS, and Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS).
* **Communication Protocols**: ROS1 utilizes TCPROS/UDPROS, relying heavily on the Master node. In contrast, ROS2 employs DDS (Data Distribution Service), which improves fault tolerance and independence from a single Master node.
* **Intra-process Communication**: ROS2 offers a more optimized transmission mechanism for intra-process communication.

### ROS2 has three main dimentions

#### The Community:

The ROS community is vital for developing applications using this middleware. In addition to providing technical documentation, it boasts a vast network of developers who contribute applications and utilities through public repositories. Often, community members have already created tools or solutions that can be beneficial to others.

#### Computation Graph:

The Computational Graph is a fundamental aspect of a running ROS 2 application. This graph consists of nodes (the primary computing units in ROS 2) and arcs (connections between nodes). Nodes can collaborate through various communication paradigms, enabling the composition of complex applications. Monitoring tools, also represented as nodes, are integrated within this graph.

#### The Workspace:

The Workspace encompasses all software installed on the robot or computer, as well as user-developed programs. Unlike the dynamic nature of the Computational Graph, the Workspace is static and also includes the development tools necessary to build the components of the graph.

***we will proceed with the comoutaion graph***

#### how the node could talk to each other :

Nodes in ROS 2 communicate with one another through three primary paradigms:

#### Publication/Subscription:

This is an asynchronous communication mechanism where multiple nodes (N) publish messages to a topic, which can be subscribed to by other nodes (M). A topic acts as a communication channel for messages of a specific type. This paradigm is widely used in ROS 2; for instance, a camera driver node publishes images to a topic that other nodes subscribe to for processing.

image

[example of publisher and subscriber method ](codes/publisher_subscriber.py)

#### Services:

This is an asynchronous communication method where a node requests another node and expects an immediate response. This is crucial for maintaining control cycles without significant delays. For example, a mapping service node may reset a map and respond to the request.

image

[example of services method ](codes/services.py)

#### Actions:

Actions allow asynchronous communication where one node requests another node to perform a task that may take time. The calling node can receive periodic feedback or notifications regarding the status of the action. An example would be a navigation request that doesn't block the requesting node while it waits for completion.

### this how the nodes could talk to each other but how the node actually works ?

Nodes in a computational graph perform processing or control, functioning as active elements with two primary execution models:

#### Iterative execution:

In this model, nodes execute their control cycles at a specific frequency, allowing precise control over resource usage and consistent output flow. For instance, a node calculating motion commands for actuators at 20 Hz based on sensor status exemplifies this approach.

code examble and image

[example of iterative execution method ](codes/iterative.py)

#### Event-oriented execution:

In this model, node execution is triggered by the arrival of specific events, such as messages. For instance, a node that processes each incoming image and performs detection based on the frequency of message arrivals illustrates this execution style.

</div>

### DDS

DDS (Data Distribution Service) is a middleware protocol used for real-time data exchange between distributed systems. In the context of ROS 2, it enables different components (or nodes) of a robot to communicate effectively.

ROS 2 has provided its own abstraction layer (rmw) on top of DDS instead of directly using the DDS middleware. Thus, the details of the DDS middleware interface are abstracted from the user.  =In the current ROS 2 versions, Fast-DDS comes as the standard DDS version

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/dds-overview.jpg" alt="ros2 dds overview" style="width: 70%; max-width: 1000px;">
</div>

Overall, DDS enhances the communication capabilities of ROS 2, making it suitable for complex robotic applications.

### ROS2 client library

ROS 2 applications access ROS 2 features through the ROS Client Library (RCL) client library. The Rcl library is written in C language and on it there are Rclcpp client libraries for C ++ language and Rclpy for Python language. There are independently written ROS 2 client libraries in other languages such as Java, Go. The client library is primarily provided with the standard interface required to exchange data with Topic and Service approaches over ROS 2. In addition, the ROS2 library has capabilities to provide operating system abstraction and ready-made micro-architectural structures.
