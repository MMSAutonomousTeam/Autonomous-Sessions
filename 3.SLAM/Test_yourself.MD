### **Critical Thinking Questions:**

1. ***SLAM systems accumulate errors over time (drift). What are the key methods used in modern SLAM algorithms to reduce or compensate for drift, and how effective are they?***(Expect discussion on loop closure, regular sensor calibration, and probabilistic techniques.)
2. ***For an autonomous drone operating in a GPS-denied environment, such as a dense forest, what specific SLAM techniques would you use to ensure accurate localization and mapping?***(Possible answers could involve visual SLAM, LIDAR, or combining IMU data with camera feeds for feature detection.)
3. ***How would you handle a situation where a robot is deployed in an environment with minimal landmarks or distinguishing features? Which SLAM techniques could be most effective in such cases?***(Responses might explore the use of odometry and IMU data, relying on relative localization rather than feature-based approaches.)
4. ***Imagine you are tasked with developing a SLAM system for an autonomous vehicle in a large, outdoor environment. What are the major challenges specific to this environment, and how would you address them?***(Challenges could include handling large-scale maps, long-range sensors like LIDAR, integrating GNSS for global localization, and managing data processing in real-time.)*
5. ***In the event of a system failure (e.g., sensor malfunction or power loss), how can SLAM ensure that the autonomous vehicle or robot can recover and resume its operation without losing significant progress in mapping and localization?***(Expect answers to focus on redundancy, checkpointing, or saving intermediate mapping data so that the system can recover without reinitializing the entire map.)
6. **Explain the importance of loop closure in SLAM and describe a situation where failing to detect a loop could lead to significant errors in both localization and mapping.***(Answer should emphasize the concept of recognizing previously visited locations and how it helps correct drift in localization and prevent map inconsistencies.)*
7. **Imagine you're designing an autonomous underwater robot using SLAM. Discuss the challenges unique to underwater environments, such as light attenuation and sensor limitations, and propose potential solutions.**
   *(Answers may cover the challenges of using cameras (due to poor light and visibility) and LIDAR (attenuation in water), suggesting alternatives like sonar, DVL (Doppler Velocity Log), or specialized SLAM techniques for underwater environments.)*
8. ***How do different types of SLAM algorithms (e.g., EKF-SLAM, FastSLAM, Graph-based SLAM) differ in their approach to handling uncertainties in both the map and robot's pose? Which one would be best for a small robot with limited computational resources and why?***(This question prompts learners to compare the algorithms in terms of complexity, scalability, and ability to handle uncertainty, with consideration for resource limitations.)
9. **Compare and contrast the use of LIDAR and visual (camera-based) SLAM systems. In what environments would each type perform best, and what are the main limitations of each?**
   *(Expected responses may highlight how LIDAR performs better in dark or featureless environments, while visual SLAM might struggle in low light or feature-poor areas but excels in more complex, detailed environments.)*
